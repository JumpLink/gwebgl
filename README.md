# gwebgl

This generates a [GObject Introspectable](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
wrapper library for [OpenGL ES](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/). The API is
designed so that when it's bound to Javascript with gjs the API is as close as
possible to [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/).

# Building

You need meson and headers etc for GTK (you can use either GTK3 or 4), epoxy and
OpenGL.

First time only:
```
meson setup build .
```

Then:
```
meson compile -C build
sudo meson install -C build
```

You may need to change the installation prefix to /usr for gobject-introspection
to work. Do this by changing the setup command:
```
meson setup --prefix=/usr build .
```
or run:
```
meson configure --prefix=/usr build
```

To uninstall the files again run:

```
cd build
sudo ninja uninstall
```

# Using the library

Javascript wrappers are required to provide (almost) full WebGL compatibility;
these are provided in the `gjs_src` folder in the source tree and installed
in `{datadir}/gwebgl`. `{datadir}` defaults to `{prefix}/share` where `{prefix}`
is usually `/usr/local` for manual installations and `/usr` for distro packages.
gjs doesn't really have an infrastructure for JS libraries, so simply copy the
JS files into your own project. Adapt the gi imports if you're not using ES6
module imports.

Create a rendering context with:
```
const gl = WebGLRenderingContext.new_for_gl_area(myGtkGLAreaWidget);
```
where `myGtkGLAreaWidget` is the GtkGLArea you're running the context in. This
will be used as the context's `canvas` property.

Where WebGL expects an image source, for example the overload of `texImage2D`
that doesn't take raw data, use a GdkPixbuf.

# GLSL versions

The shader language version to use depends both on whether you're using WebGL 1
or 2 and whether the GDKGLContext is ES. The JS wrappers include an override
for `shaderSource` that will add the appropriate version tag. Leave the first
line of your shader source blank, then the wrapper doesn't need to add an
aditional newline, causing a discrepancy in any error messages. You can still
provide a version tag if you want to override what gwebgl chooses automatically.

# OpenGL ES with GTK

Currently, [requesting a GLES context in GTK/GDK from code gets
ignored](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/4221). If you're lucky your
distro will have GTK built with certain debugging features enabled, then you can
set the environment variable `GDK_DEBUG=gl-gles`. This works in Arch Linux, but
I haven't tried other distros.

The demos currently simply use gl.clear to make the window background
black. The C demo is a leftover from early debugging, and the gjs demo will be
developed into something more interesting.

The gjs demo can be run via the `rundemo.sh` script. To use GTK3 instead of
GTK4 change the 4 to 3 on the first line of `demo.js`.

To compile and run the C demo from the source directory without installing:

```
gcc -o cdemo `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk4 epoxy` -I./build -L./build -lgwebgl cdemo.c
GDK_DEBUG=gl-gles,opengl MESA_DEBUG=1 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build ./cdemo
```
For GTK3 change the `gtk4` above to `gtk+-3.0`.

# GwebglGtk

A pair of mini-modules is provided, both created from the same source.
`GwebglGtk-3.0` and `GwebglGtk-4.0` are for `Gtk-3.0` and `Gtk-4.0`
respectively. They provide a single function
`GwebglGtk.queue_render_when_idle(glarea)`, which takes a `Gtk.GLArea widget`
as its parameter. This sets up an idle callback to call
`gtk_gl_area_queue_render()`.  This is useful because calling
`gtk_gl_area_queue_render` while already handling a "render" signal has no
effect, and using `GLib.idle_add` in gjs seems to break it, by causing attempts
to run JS callbacks during garbage collection.

# How the constants are modelled

The generated C code for classes that include property constants in WebGL stores
them in hash tables which are available via static methods. The JS wrappers
read these tables and add properties to the class prototypes. This is the
simplest way and reasonably efficient at run-time after the classes have been
defined. Conventional GObject properties don't work here because gjs doesn't
support them with upper case names.
